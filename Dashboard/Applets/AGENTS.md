# Applet Instructions

- Each applet must be entirely self-contained and independent from other applets.
- Applets may only interact with the Dashboard through explicit interfaces exposed by the Dashboard layer.
- Avoid shared state between applets. Any shared utilities must live outside `Dashboard/Applets/` and be stable for all applets.

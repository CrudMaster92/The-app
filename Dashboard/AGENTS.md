# Dashboard Instructions

- The Dashboard serves as the independent launcher and menu for the application.
- Keep Dashboard logic self-contained. It may expose hooks or interfaces for applets, but it must not depend on applet internals.
- Communication with applets should happen through stable, documented interfaces.
